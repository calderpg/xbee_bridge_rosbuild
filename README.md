xbee_bridge
===========

General-purpose ROS-ROS message transport over serial ports and compatible Xbee radios.

This package is no longer being maintained and exists for historical reasons. It has been replaced by [xbee_bridge](https://github.com/calderpg/xbee_bridge) for ROS Groovy and above. You should only use this package if you need compatibility with ROS Fuerte.
